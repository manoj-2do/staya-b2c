# Project Vibe — Staya

## What is Staya?

Staya is a modern, seamless travel booking platform where users can explore and book hotels, flights, and holiday packages without feeling overwhelmed. The experience should feel smooth, intuitive, and thoughtfully curated rather than dense or transactional.

Staya is not just for booking — it's for *browsing comfortably*, discovering deals, and enjoying the process of planning travel.

## Who It’s For

Staya is designed for travelers who:
- Prefer clean, distraction-free websites  
- Get overwhelmed by too much information at once  
- Like exploring travel options at their own pace  
- Care about good design and smooth user experience  

This is for users who want travel planning to feel easy, not exhausting.

## Core Experience Feel

The product should feel:

- Clean and breathable  
- Calm and intuitive  
- Visually refined but not flashy  
- Effortless to navigate  
- Experience-focused, not data-dump focused  

The design and UX should follow a philosophy similar to Airbnb:
- Strong visual hierarchy  
- Cards and sections instead of dense tables  
- Guided discovery instead of overwhelming choice  
- Friendly and human, not technical

## Anti-Vibe (What We Avoid)

Staya must **not** feel:

- Corporate or enterprise  
- Cluttered or information-heavy  
- Like a comparison spreadsheet  
- Overloaded with filters, numbers, and dense UI  
- Aggressive with popups, banners, or distractions  

If a screen feels busy, it should be simplified.

## Product Principles

These principles guide all design and engineering decisions:

1. **Clarity over quantity** – Show only what matters right now  
2. **Browsing should feel enjoyable** – Not like completing a form  
3. **Guide the user** – Don’t make them figure things out alone  
4. **Visual structure is functional** – Layout should reduce cognitive load  
5. **Speed and smoothness matter** – Interactions should feel fast and fluid  
6. **Consistency builds trust** – Reuse patterns instead of inventing new ones

## UX Direction

- Homepage should feel inviting and inspirational, not transactional  
- Major categories (Hotels, Flights, Packages) should be clearly visible and easy to access  
- The Hotels booking flow should feel step-by-step and guided  
- Users should always feel oriented — never lost in the process  


## Color Scheme

Primary Color: Purple (used for main actions, highlights, active states)  
Secondary/Base: White & very light neutrals  

Style direction is similar to Airbnb’s clean and spacious interface, but using purple instead of red.

## UI Principles

- Prefer cards over dense tables
- Avoid visual clutter
- Use whitespace generously
- One primary action per section
- Clear visual hierarchy using size, spacing, and contrast
